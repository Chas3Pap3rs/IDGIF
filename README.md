# IDGIF

By: Chase Poulton

Overview of Project:
    This is a simple webpage with a search form utilizing the GIPHY API. Essentially, a GIF search engine. Simple and concise design, a satisfying minimalist approach. There is a random button that shows the results of searching: Random. When a search is initiated from the home page the search-page opens with the search results showing, there is a drop down list from this page that gives the user a few resources for GIF's (including how to make them!).

Details on how to use it or what functionaliy is offered:
    Simply search for what type of GIFs you want, or click rabdom if you can't think of anything. Display adjusts the amount of columns of images to ensure you do not overlook any of the search results. You can click on any image from your search results and it will copy the URL of the image.

Technology Used:
    .html, .css, .js, images, Bootstrap, Google Fonts, 

Ideas for future improvements:
    1. Make clicking the image/gif copy the image/gif and ensure someone can paste it with the gif working as expected.
    2. Add a search for Stickers via Giphy
    3.
