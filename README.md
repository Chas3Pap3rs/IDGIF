# IDGIF

By: Chase Poulton

Overview of Project:
    This is a simple webpage with a search form utilizing the GIPHY API. Essentially, a GIF search engine. Simple and concise design, a satisfying minimalist approach. There is a random button that shows the results of searching: Random. When a search is initiated from the home page the search-page opens with the search results showing, there is a drop down list from this page that gives the user a few resources for GIF's (including how to make them!).

Details on how to use it or what functionaliy is offered:
    Simply search for what type of GIFs you want, or click rabdom if you can't think of anything. Display adjusts the amount of columns of images to ensure you do not overlook any of the search results. You can click on any image from your search results and it will copy the URL of the image.

Technology Used:
    .html, .css, .js, images, Bootstrap, Google Fonts(Madimi One), 

Ideas for future improvements:
    1. Make clicking the image/gif copy the image/gif and ensure someone can paste it with the gif working as expected.
    2. Add a search for Stickers via Giphy
    3. Make the "Random" selection/button start utilizing another API that generates random words (Like the one by API Ninjas, herokuapp, etc) so that the 2nd time and on that a user clicks "Random" new results are shown.


1) Create at least 3 user stories:
	1. User wants to search for gifs, enters desired input and gets back relative gif’s
	2. User wants to see a random search for gifs so hits “random” button”
	3. User doesn't find what they want in a search and checks resources and gets links to other good gif searches
2) Create wireframes for desktop and mobile views: Attached/included in files, IDGIF WIREFRAME.pdf
